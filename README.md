# Knee Osteoarthritis Classification Using Bone Distance

This project presents a Jupyter notebook for classifying Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) severity using bone distance features extracted from medical imaging data.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook performs:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature extraction using bone distance measurements
- Model training (e.g., XGBoost, SVM)
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy and F1-score
- Final submission predictions

## 📁 Files

- `Knee_OA_Classification_Using_Bone_Distance_Final_Submission.ipynb` — main notebook
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies for running the notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and install the requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milindchoudryus/-Knee-Osteoarthritis-OA-Severity-Classification-Using-Computer-Vision.git
cd Knee-OA-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.

## 📊 Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for full list of libraries.
